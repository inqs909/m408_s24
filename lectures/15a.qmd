# Sequential Data

## Sequential Data

Sequential data is data that is obtained in a series:

$$
X_{(0)}\rightarrow
X_{(1)}\rightarrow
X_{(2)}\rightarrow
X_{(3)}\rightarrow
\cdots\rightarrow
X_{(J-1)}\rightarrow
X_{(J)}
$$ \## Stochastic Procceses

A stochastic process is a collection of random variables, that can be indexed by a parameters. Sequential data can be thought of as a stochastic process.

::: fragment
The generation of a variable $X_{(j)}$ may or may not be dependent of the previous values.

## Examples of Sequential Data

-   Documents and Books

-   Temperature

-   Stock Prices

-   Speech/Recordings

-   Handwriting

# Recurrent Neural Networks

## RNN

Recurrent Neural Networks are designed to analyze input data that is sequential data.

::: fragment
An RNN can accounts for the position of a data point in the sequence as well as the distance it has to other data points.
:::

::: fragment
Using the data sequence, we can predict and outcome $Y$.
