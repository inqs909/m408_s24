# Sequential Data

## Sequential Data

Sequential data is data that is obtained in a series:

$$
X_{(0)}\rightarrow
X_{(1)}\rightarrow
X_{(2)}\rightarrow
X_{(3)}\rightarrow
\cdots\rightarrow
X_{(J-1)}\rightarrow
X_{(J)}
$$ 


## Stochastic Procceses

A stochastic process is a collection of random variables, that can be indexed by a parameters. Sequential data can be thought of as a stochastic process.

::: fragment
The generation of a variable $X_{(j)}$ may or may not be dependent of the previous values.

## Examples of Sequential Data

-   Documents and Books

-   Temperature

-   Stock Prices

-   Speech/Recordings

-   Handwriting

# Recurrent Neural Networks

## RNN

Recurrent Neural Networks are designed to analyze input data that is sequential data.

::: fragment
An RNN can accounts for the position of a data point in the sequence as well as the distance it has to other data points.
:::

::: fragment
Using the data sequence, we can predict and outcome $Y$.

## RNN Inputs

$$
\boldsymbol X = (\boldsymbol x_0, \boldsymbol x_1, \boldsymbol x_2, \cdots, \boldsymbol x_{J-1}, \boldsymbol x_J)
$$
where 

$$
\boldsymbol x_{j} = (x_{j1},x_{j1}, \cdots, x_{jK})
$$

## Hidden Layer

$$
h_{j} = f(\bbeta_{hx}\boldsymbol x_{j} + \bbeta_{hh}h_{j-1} + b_h)
$$

- $\bbeta_{hx}$ and $\bbeta_{hh}$ are weight vectors for input-to-hidden, and hidden-to-hidden connections respectively.

## Output Layer

$$
y_{j} = g(\bbeta_{hy}h_{j} + b_y)
$$
