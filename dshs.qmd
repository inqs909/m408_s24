# Data Science

## What is Data Science?

## Statistics

- Knowing how to apply mathematical models to data
- Understand the data generating process (probability theory)
- Construction of statistical estimators to model data

## Simple Model

For a sample $\{X_i, Y_i\}^n_{i=1}$, we claim that

$$
Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_i + \epsilon_i
$$

- $\beta_0$, $\beta_1$: Regression Coefficients
- $\epsilon_i$: Error term

## Goal

Construct

$$
\hat Y_i = \hat\beta_0 + \hat \beta_1 X_i
$$

## Coding

This is the process of handling large amounts of data for analysis. This includes:

- Data Collection
- Data Storage
- Data Cleaning
- Analysis

## Size of Data

With the ease of collecting data, large amounts of data are being collected (> 1 GB)

## Domain Knowledge

***The most crucial part!***

Not knowing how a scientific fields collect data, or the lack of knowledge, can lead faulty results.
