However, they have limited computing resources. Be mindful of your experimentation. You may also be able to use Quarto in Rstudio cloud.\n\nYou can install R via their website: <https://www.r-project.org/>.\n\nYou can install RStudio for free from their website: <https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/>\n\n#### Using R\n\nR can be used as a calculator; below are a few examples:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n1+2\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 3\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n3/4\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 0.75\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n9*8\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 72\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nexp(4)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 54.59815\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n#### Types of Data\n\n##### Numeric\n\nThese types of data are stored as a number in R. They may be whole numbers or contains decimal values known as double.\n\n##### Character/String\n\nThis type of data is stored a string of character values. They are usually surrounded by quotes in the output.\n\n##### Logical\n\nThis type of data indicates `TRUE` or `FALSE` data. It is binary data.\n\n##### Missing\n\nThis indicates that a value is missing or not computed. Commonly stored as `NA` or `NaN`.\n\n### Second Lecture\n\n#### R Functions\n\nR has specialized functions that can compute specific values. R functions require inputs, known as arguments, to produce a specific output.\n\nFor example, the `log()` function can be used to compute the natural logarithm of a specified input:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlog(34)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 3.526361\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIf you want to know information about a specific function, you can use the `?` operator:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n?log\n```\n:::\n\n\nwhich will open the help tab. Notice there are 2 arguments: `x` and `base`. This means that the `log()` function can be extended to other base. To use common log[^1], specify the arguments:\n\n[^1]: $\\log_{10}(x)$\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlog(x=34, base=10)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 1.531479\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNotice that I specified the arguments. You can also type this:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlog(34, 10)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 1.531479\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nwhich produces the same results. This is because R uses positions in the function to determine argument values; therefore, if the positions are correct, you do not need to specify the argument name.\n\nGoing back to the First Lecture example, `log(34)`, we did not specify the base. This is because functions have default values for arguments. The help documentation tells us what arguments have defaults and do not need to be specified.\n\n#### R Objects\n\n#### Install packages\n\nYou can extend the functionality of R. The [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) package includes a popular set of R packages for data wrangling and analysis. To install tidyverse, use the `install.packages()` function[^2]:\n\n[^2]: The package name must be inputted with quotes in the function.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ninstall.packages('tidyverse')\n```\n:::\n\n\nOnce you installed the R package, you will need to load with every R session using the `library()` function:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Resources\n\n| Lecture | Slides | Videos | Files |\n|---------|--------|--------|-------|\n| 1       |        |        |       |\n| 2       |        |        |       |\n",
