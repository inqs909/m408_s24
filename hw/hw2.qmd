## Problem 1

Write a function that takes a vector as an input an returns a labeled list with the mean, median, and variance of the vector.

## Problem 2

Write a function for the following equation:

$$
f(x, y, z) =\left\{\begin{array}{cc}
x^2+\sqrt y & z  = 0 \\ 
x^2+2x+3+ \log(y) & z = 1
\end{array}\right.
$$

Include any error messages if necessary.

## Problem 3

Create a function that will give you the first `x` Fibonacci numbers. You must use a `for` loop.

## Problem 4

Create a function that will randomly generate `n` numbers that are greater than `x` from a $Pois(\lambda)$.
