Use an RMD Notebook file from to create the assignment.

You must comment all your code to receive credit.

Submit the \*nb.html file to canvas.

For all problems, you must use at least one `for` or `while` loop.

## Problem 1

Using the following code:

```{r}
x <- matrix(rnorm(1500), nrow = 10)
```

Write the code to produce the output if you use the `rowMeans()` on the R object `x`.

## Problem 2

Write the code to generate the 10th row of Pascal's Triangle.

## Problem 3

Using the following code:

```{r}
y <- matrix(sample(1:400, 100, replace = T), nrow = 10)
```

Find the median value for each column of the matrix `y`. You are not allowed to use the `median()` function.

## Problem 4

Write the code that will generate the first 1000 numbers of the Fibonacci sequence.
