# Neural Networks

## Neural Networks

Neural networks are a type of machine learning algorithm that are designed to mimic the function of the human brain. They consist of interconnected nodes or "neurons" that process information and generate outputs based on the inputs they receive.

## Uses

Neural networks are typically used for tasks such as image recognition, natural language processing, and prediction. They are capable of learning from data and improving their performance over time, which makes them well-suited for complex and dynamic problems.

## Single Layer Neural Networks

A single layer neural networks can be formulated as linear function:

$$
f(X) = \beta_0 + \sum^K_{k=1}\beta_kh_k(X)
$$

Where $X$ is a vector of inputs of length $p$ and $K$ is the number of activations, $\beta_j$ are the regression coefficients and

$$
h_k(X) = A_k = g(w_{k0} + \sum^p_{l1}w_{kl}X_{l})
$$

with $g(\cdot)$ being a nonlinear function and $w_{kl}$ are the weights.

## Nonlinear Function $g(\cdot)$

-   $g(z) = \frac{e^z}{1+e^z}$

-   $g(z) = (z)_+ = zI(z\geq0)$

## Multilayer Neural Network

Multilayer Neural Networks create multiple hidden layers where each layer feeds into each other which will create a final outcome.
