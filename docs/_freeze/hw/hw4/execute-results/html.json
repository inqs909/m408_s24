Describe the relationship between `waiting` (independent) and `eruptions` (dependent).\n\nYou must provide descriptive statistics, visuals, and model.\n\n## Problem 2\n\nThe `cats` data set from the `MASS` package contains information of cat body weight (kg; `Bwt`) and heart weight (g; `Hwt`). Fit a model to see if there is a significant association between body weight (predictor) and heart weight (outcome).\n\nYou must provide descriptive statistics, visuals, and model.\n\n## Problem 3\n\nWhen estimating the $\\beta$ coefficients, we are minimizing the sum of error squares:\n\n$$\n\\sum^n_{i=1}(y_i-(\\beta_0+\\beta_1x_i))^2\n$$\n\nWe square the errors to make sure we do not lose information when summing up all the values. However, what if we try to use an absolute value:\n\n$$\n\\sum^n_{i=1}|y_i-(\\beta_0+\\beta_1x_i)|\n$$\n\nSimulate a data set, estimate the coefficients, and compare the results. Are they the same or different?\n\n## Problem 4\n\nConduct a simulation assessing which case from problem 3 is better.\n\nTo assess which case is better compare the mean and standard deviations of the simulated-estimated coefficients.\n",
